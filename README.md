## My new website is powered by jekyll
This post is meant to give creadit to jekyll, Ruby and Jekflix-Template.

I used them to modify and create the updated version on my new website, other various scripts and api sources integrated within my old webstie and the new one, mixed together as a personal platform. That helps me to automate and speed up things for me. The licence is MIT and anyone can use my work and the work of others, giving credit where needed.

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. 
Before starting, make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
Jekyll can be located here: [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/),
 [Jekflix-Template-here](https://github.com/thiagorossener/jekflix-template/)
